Hey üëã! I graduated from Princeton University advised by Professor <a href="https://www.cs.princeton.edu/~karthikn/">Karthik Narasimhan</a>, Dr. <a href="https://machineslearner.com">Khanh Nguyen</a>, and Professor <a href="https://www.cs.princeton.edu/~li/">Kai Li</a>. There, I received the **<a href="https://www.cs.princeton.edu/news/class-day-department-celebrates-accomplishments-graduates">Phillip Goldman '86 Senior Prize in Computer Science</a>**, which is the Princeton CS department's highest academic honor awarded to a single student. 

Right now, I'm particularly interested in systems for/in ML, scaling and understanding language models, and applications of AI to the natural sciences!

The most recent projects (+ research) I've led / majorly contributed to are:

<ul>
<li> Open source <a href="https://gpu-mode.github.io/popcorn/">Project Popcorn üçø</a> for generating GPU kernels with LLMs. </li>
<li> <a href="https://www.swebench.com/multimodal.html">Multi-modal task instances for SWEBench</a> with the original authors. </li>
<li> Fast <a href="https://github.com/Ligo-Biosciences/AlphaFold3?tab=readme-ov-file#msa-pair-averaging-efficiency"> kernels for scaling Ligo's open source AlphaFold3</a>. </li>
<li> World models that can be <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.01695">conditioned on language </a> for model-based agents. </li>
<li> Simple <a href="https://github.com/alexzhang13/flashattention2-custom-mask">FlashAttention2 with custom masks</a> in Triton. </li>
</ul>

<!-- in  and <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.04449">guiding</a> agent behavior in different data modalities</b> to create more reliable, interpretable, and less data hungry AI models. I'm also very interested -->
