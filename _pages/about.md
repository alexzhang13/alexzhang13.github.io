The first thing you should do is check out **[vgbench.com](https://www.vgbench.com/)**, and then go participate in the **[AMD x GPU MODE $100K GPU coding competition](https://www.datamonsters.com/amd-developer-challenge-2025)**!

Hey üëã! I recently graduated after spending a wonderful 4 years at Princeton University advised by Professor <a href="https://www.cs.princeton.edu/~karthikn/">Karthik Narasimhan</a>, Dr. <a href="https://machineslearner.com">Khanh Nguyen</a>, and Professor <a href="https://www.cs.princeton.edu/~li/">Kai Li</a>. There, I received the **<a href="https://www.cs.princeton.edu/news/class-day-department-celebrates-accomplishments-graduates">Phillip Goldman '86 Senior Prize in Computer Science</a>**, which is awarded to the top undergraduate student in the Princeton CS department.

<!-- in  and <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.04449">guiding</a> agent behavior in different data modalities</b> to create more reliable, interpretable, and less data hungry AI models. I'm also very interested -->

Feel free to reach out to talk through
my email at [x]@princeton.edu where [x]=alzhang. 
I'm also very active in the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCJgIbYl6C5no72a0NUAPcTA">GPU MODE</a> community and 
co-lead the <a href="https://www.gpumode.com/">GPU programming leaderboard</a>!

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.1rem;"><b>Random.</b> I got into AI research because I wanted to design intelligent bots for video games when I was younger:</p>
<ul>
<li> <em> I first started programming by making Android games in Java. </em> </li>
<li> <em> I used to make and sell PC games, one of which was mildly successful (~100k+ players). <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Mmfo44FxhA">UE4 unfinished example.</a> </em> </li>
<li> <em> My favorite games of all time are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xenoblade_Chronicles_(video_game)">Xenoblade Chronicles</a> and <a href="https://www.teamfortress.com/">Team Fortress 2</a>. </em> </li>
