Hey ðŸ‘‹! I graduated from Princeton CS advised by Professor <a href="https://www.cs.princeton.edu/~karthikn/">Karthik Narasimhan</a>, Dr. <a href="https://machineslearner.com">Khanh Nguyen</a>, and Professor <a href="https://www.cs.princeton.edu/~li/">Kai Li</a>. There, I received the **<a href="https://www.cs.princeton.edu/news/class-day-department-celebrates-accomplishments-graduates">Phillip Goldman '86 Senior Prize in Computer Science</a>**, which is the Princeton CS department's highest academic honor awarded to a single student. 

Right now, I'm particularly interested in 

<ul>
<li> Efficient <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.14135">training</a> and <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.01318">inference</a> of AI models at a systems-level </li>
<li> Language <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.17593">grounding</a> across different data modalities </li>
<li> <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.04449">Guiding agent behavior</a> through <a href="https://github.com/alexzhang13/world-models-papers/">world model representations </a> </li>
</ul>

<!-- in  and <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.04449">guiding</a> agent behavior in different data modalities</b> to create more reliable, interpretable, and less data hungry AI models. I'm also very interested -->
