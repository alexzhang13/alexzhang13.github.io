Hey üëã! I graduated from Princeton University advised by Professor <a href="https://www.cs.princeton.edu/~karthikn/">Karthik Narasimhan</a>, Dr. <a href="https://machineslearner.com">Khanh Nguyen</a>, and Professor <a href="https://www.cs.princeton.edu/~li/">Kai Li</a>. There, I received the **<a href="https://www.cs.princeton.edu/news/class-day-department-celebrates-accomplishments-graduates">Phillip Goldman '86 Senior Prize in Computer Science</a>**, which is awarded to the top undergraduate student in the Princeton CS department.

Right now, I'm particularly interested in systems for/in ML, scaling and understanding language models, and applications of AI to the natural sciences!

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.5rem;">The most recent projects (+ research) I've led / majorly contributed to are (in order of recency):</p>

<ul>
<li> <a href="https://www.vant.ai/neo-1"><b>Neo-1</b></a>, the first model for de novo molecular generation + structure prediction. </li>
<li> Open source <a href="https://gpu-mode.github.io/popcorn/">Project Popcorn üçø</a> for <b>generating GPU kernels with LLMs</b> </li>
<li> <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10517v1">KernelBench</a>: environment for evaluating LLM-generated CUDA / Triton kernels.</li>
<li> <a href="https://www.swebench.com/multimodal.html">Multi-modal task instances for <b>SWE-bench</b></a> <img src="assets/img/swellamamm.png" alt="emoji" width="20" style="vertical-align: middle;"> with the original authors. </li>
<li> Fast <a href="https://github.com/Ligo-Biosciences/AlphaFold3?tab=readme-ov-file#msa-pair-averaging-efficiency"> kernels for scaling Ligo's <b>open source AlphaFold3</b></a>, <b>900+ GitHub ‚≠ê's</b>. </li>
</ul>

<!-- in  and <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.04449">guiding</a> agent behavior in different data modalities</b> to create more reliable, interpretable, and less data hungry AI models. I'm also very interested -->

Feel free to reach out to talk through
my email at [x]@princeton.edu where [x]=alzhang. I'm also very active in the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCJgIbYl6C5no72a0NUAPcTA">GPU MODE</a> community and co-lead the <a href=https://gpu-mode.github.io/discord-cluster-manager/docs/intro/">GPU programming leaderboard</a>!

<hr>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.1rem;">I got into AI research because I wanted to design intelligent bots for video games when I was younger:</p>
<ul>
<li> <em> I first started programming by making Android games in Java. </em> </li>
<li> <em> I used to make and sell PC games, one of which was mildly successful (~100k+ players). <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Mmfo44FxhA">UE4 unfinished example.</a> </em> </li>
<li> <em> My favorite games of all time are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xenoblade_Chronicles_(video_game)">Xenoblade Chronicles</a> and <a href="https://www.teamfortress.com/">Team Fortress 2</a>. </em> </li>
</ul>
